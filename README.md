Print PDFs and images over IPP (Internet Printing Protocol). Most, but not all, IPP-capable printers are supported. For printing PDFs, SeaPrint relies on the printer either supporting PDF natively, or the optional dependency `poppler-utils` to convert to Postscript, PWG-raster or URF-raster. Images can be printed on printers accepting JPEG, PNG and GIF as well as PWG-raster or URF-raster.
